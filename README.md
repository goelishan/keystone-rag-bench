# Keystone RAG Bench

Keystone RAG Bench is a modular benchmarking framework designed to study
latency, retrieval quality, and ranking trade-offs in Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) systems.

The project focuses on comparing dense and hybrid retrieval strategies,
optional re-ranking, and prompt configurations using real-world corpora.

> This project is under active development. Architecture-first design,
measured experiments, and reproducibility are core principles.
